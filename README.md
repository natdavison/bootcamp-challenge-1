# Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description
For this project, I was given some starter code which I needed to re-factor and make more accessible. It is a static web-page, written in HTML and CSS.

While working on this project, I learned a lot about semantic HTML and how important it is to utilise this for accessibility and SEO - this includes the use of attributes such as alt within img tags, as well as using sectioning elements such as header, article and section. In regards to CSS, I learned about grouping classes and selectors to make the code more readable and less repetitive. I also learned about the importance of commenting within HTML and CSS.
